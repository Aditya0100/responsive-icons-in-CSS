how to make CSS icons responsive!
## Project Overview
This is a small and simple project which will teach you how to make CSS icons responsive.
### Things to note!!!
People often use media queries to make fonts responsive, but here I would prefer you guys to use clamp as this property is very short to use as we only need to add 1 line of CSS! then in order to make every thing responsive I used relative units like `em, rem, vw, vh and %`. And colors of all social media icons is available on internet easily.
